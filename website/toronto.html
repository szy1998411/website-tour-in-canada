    <p>The University of Toronto (U of T, UToronto, or Toronto) is a public research university in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on the grounds that surround Queen's Park. It was founded by royal charter in 1827 as King's College, the first institution of higher learning in the colony of Upper Canada. Originally controlled by the Church of England, the university assumed the present name in 1850 upon becoming a secular institution. As a collegiate university, it comprises eleven colleges, which differ in character and history, each with substantial autonomy on financial and institutional affairs.

    <p>Casa Loma (Spanish for Hill House) is a Gothic Revival style house and gardens in midtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, that is now a museum and landmark. It was built as a residence for financier Sir Henry Mill Pellatt. Casa Loma was constructed from 1911 to 1914. The architect was E. J. Lennox,[1] who designed several other city landmarks. Casa Loma sits at an elevation of 140 metres (460 ft) above sea level. Due to its unique architectural character in Toronto, Casa Loma has been a popular filming location for movies and television. It is a popular venue for wedding ceremonies.[3] The historic place can be rented in the afternoons after the museum closes to the public.</p>
